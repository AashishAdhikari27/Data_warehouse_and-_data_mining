    "# Lab 2: Apriori Algorithm and Its Details\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "The Apriori Algorithm is used for mining frequent itemsets and generating association rules in a transactional dataset. It is a fundamental algorithm in the field of **Market Basket Analysis**, where it is used to find patterns and relationships between products purchased together.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Apriori Algorithm** follows an iterative approach to discover frequent itemsets in a dataset. Frequent itemsets are sets of items that appear together frequently in transactions. The algorithm uses **support** and **confidence** to determine the frequency and strength of association rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transaction**: A record that consists of a set of items purchased by a customer.\n",
    "2. **Itemset**: A collection of items from a transaction.\n",
    "3. **Frequent Itemset**: An itemset whose support count is above a predefined threshold, called **Minimum Support**.\n",
    "4. **Support**: The frequency or proportion of transactions that contain a specific itemset.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The formula for support is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$ \n",
    "   \\text{Support}(A) = \\frac{\\text{Count of transactions containing A}}{\\text{Total number of transactions}} \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Confidence**: A measure of the likelihood that an itemset occurs, given that another itemset occurs. It is used to generate **association rules**.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The formula for confidence is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$ \n",
    "   \\text{Confidence}(A \\to B) = \\frac{\\text{Support}(A \\cup B)}{\\text{Support}(A)} \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \n",

    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Apriori algorithm proceeds through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate Candidate Itemsets**:\n",
    "   - Start by identifying **1-itemsets** (single items in the dataset).\n",
    "   - Then, iteratively combine frequent itemsets of size `k` to generate candidate itemsets of size `k+1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Support for Itemsets**:\n",
    "   - For each candidate itemset, calculate the **support** by counting how many transactions contain that itemset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prune Itemsets**:\n",
    "   - Remove itemsets that do not meet the minimum support threshold.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Repeat**:\n",
    "   - Repeat steps 1-3 for larger itemsets until no more frequent itemsets are found.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Generate Association Rules**:\n",
    "   - From the frequent itemsets, generate **association rules** with a minimum confidence threshold.\n",
    "   - The rules are of the form: **{Item A} → {Item B}**, meaning if **Item A** is bought, **Item B** is likely to be bought.\n",

    "## Steps in the Apriori Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate Candidate Itemsets**:\n",
    "   - Start with **1-itemsets**: {Milk}, {Bread}, {Butter}, {Eggs}.\n",
    "   - Then, generate **2-itemsets** from frequent 1-itemsets: {Milk, Bread}, {Milk, Butter}, {Bread, Butter}, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Support**:\n",
    "   - Calculate support for each itemset by counting how many transactions contain them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prune Itemsets**:\n",
    "   - Discard itemsets that do not meet the minimum support threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generate Association Rules**:\n",
    "   - From frequent itemsets, generate association rules, e.g., {Milk} → {Bread} with high confidence.\n",

    "The Apriori Algorithm is a powerful technique for discovering frequent patterns and associations in large datasets. It is widely used in **Market Basket Analysis** to help retailers understand customer purchasing behavior. By applying the Apriori algorithm, retailers can improve marketing strategies, product placement, and inventory management.\n",
